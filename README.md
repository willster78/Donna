# DONNA: Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning System for Churn Prevention

**Production-grade AI system** that learns optimal user retention strategies through reinforcement learning, continuous adaptation, and multi-agent coordination.

## 🧠 What This Actually Does

**Multi-Agent Intelligence Hub:** Orchestrates 6+ specialized ML systems through an RLBridge that creates emergent intelligence far beyond traditional churn detection.

**Reinforcement Learning Engine:** Uses Thompson sampling and policy gradients to learn optimal intervention strategies from real user outcomes (churn/retention events).

**Continuous Learning:** Models automatically improve from every user interaction, with incremental updates, performance monitoring, and automatic rollback on degradation.

**Personalized Interventions:** User-specific behavioral modeling with cross-user pattern learning for contextually perfect responses.

**Ensemble Intelligence:** Combines RL decisions, traditional ML predictions, and personalized insights with adaptive confidence thresholds.
